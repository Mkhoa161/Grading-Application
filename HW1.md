[x] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was how I should use the <form> tag with inputs and buttons, and how I should link label's 'for' attribute with input's 'id' attribute

The hardest thing in this assignment was to decide which tags should be used for the Username and Password in the Login Page. I am chose <ul>, but I think <table> is also a choice.
