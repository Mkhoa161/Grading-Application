I discussed this assignment with:
    I didn't discuss this assignment with anyone. I just tried my best to look up the documentation of Django templates and ask question on Piazza whenever I got stucked.

[x] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was how to implement the view functions to use the backend data to render the views. It's also very interesting to learn to use the model.py file to create the relationships between models in the database.

The hardest thing in this assignment was to use the Django templates appropriately. It took me a lot of time to figure out how to retrieve the data from the database and pass it to the templates so that the data is rendered properly, and also it's hard to learn how to write code in html files, but it's actually very useful as it makes the html files much simpler and more concise.
